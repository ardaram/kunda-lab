# Making Cancer Treatable

Welcome to the Kunda Lab website!!
Our lab at St. John's University, within the department of Industrial Pharmacy, specializes in using nanotechnology in developing therapeutics against infectious disease and cancer, synthesizing polymeric nanoparticles and attaching targeting moieties for site-specific delivery, and drug and vaccine formulation for pulmonary delivery. Our research publications cover a wide variety of topics including formulation, drug delivery, stabilization of vaccines, and health effects due to common environmental toxicants.

Our research publications cover a wide variety of topics including formulation, drug delivery, stabilization of vaccines, and health effects due to common environmental toxicants. Our lab specializes in developing dry powder biologics that do not require cold-chain for storage and transport thereby decreasing the cost of biologics-based products significantly.
