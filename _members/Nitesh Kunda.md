My lab specializes in using nanotechnology in developing therapeutics against infectious disease and cancer, synthesizing polymeric nanoparticles and attaching targeting moieties for site-specific delivery, and drug and vaccine formulation for pulmonary delivery. My research publications cover a wide variety of topics including formulation, drug delivery, stabilization of vaccines, and health effects due to common environmental toxicants. I am also currently editing a book with Springer Publishing, focusing on mucosal delivery of drugs and biologics in nanoparticles, in the AAPS Advances in the Pharmaceutical Sciences series.
